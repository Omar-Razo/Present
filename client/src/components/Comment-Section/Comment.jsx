// in this component there should be the user who posted the image on the top with their profile pic username and their caption
// underneath there should be a prompt that says add a comment
// if there are comments already they should be rendered with the commenters profile pic, username, and their comment
// each comment at the top layer should have a reply prompt, and should be expanded when clicked on to render all the replies
// the simplest component would be a profile pic a username and text
