# Present

## A Photo Centric Social Media Application

### Overview

Capture The ... Present. Present is a photo centric social media application optimized for mobile devices that allows users to post photos once daily to share where they are or what they are currently doing in the present moment. To avoid stale content, Users feeds are only able to publicly display the posts of the last 7 days. All posts older than 7 days will be hidden from the feed in the user's personal scrapbook. Users are also able to leave comments and likes on other users' posts.
